# DORA

**[DORA](https://dora.on-eva.io) is our API test application or 'service explorer'. It is a valuable asset when setting up a new connection to EVA or when trying out specific services.**

When opening DORA for the first-time, you will be greeted with the following screen where you are asked to connect to an endpoint:

## Connecting your endpoint

You need DORA to point to the correct endpoint so that any services performed do actually impact on your environment. To set that up, either use `CMD/CTRL + P` or click the endpoint bar in the bottom left corner of the screen. If it's your first-time on DORA then you'll automatically be prompted with the above screenshot where that can be done.

## Logging in

After specifying your desired endpoint, you need to log in using valid credentials for that environment.

## Performing requests

After logging in, you can search through all of our services. You can use these services with our code editor (JS or JSON) or form inputs.
