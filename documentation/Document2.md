# Stencil

  

EVA has a lot of functionalities where some form of user-friendly communication is desired. Think of invoices, thermal receipts, password reset mailings, end-of-day reports, click-and-collect order mailings and so on. You manage these outputs in Stencil.

The basic idea behind stencil is super simple; you can build a stencil in our HTML editor, optionally supported with some JavaScript functions (Helpers). Before diving into the details, we need to go over a few Stencil terms:

  

- **Type**

- **Name**

- **Destination**

- Stencil matching

- Data model

- Helper functions

  

## Stencil Types

  

A Stencil can have one of three types:

  

1. *Template*

2. *Partial*

3. *Layout*
